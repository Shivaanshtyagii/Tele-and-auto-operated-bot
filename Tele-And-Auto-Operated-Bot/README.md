Our mission was to enable remote control and interaction with a robot in the ROS framework, both in simulation and physical hardware, using keyboard input.
We implemented the Goal-To-Goal algorithm in Turtlesim. Programmed autonomous algorithm with ultrasonic sensors on hardware.
The pinnacle of our achievement: An Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Robot, dynamically navigating its path based on encountered obstacles.
